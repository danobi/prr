# Acquire Github token

`prr` needs a token so it can make Github API calls on your behalf.

Create the token by going to:

```
Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Generate new token
```

and give the token `repo` permissions. Keep the newly generated token handy
for the next step.
